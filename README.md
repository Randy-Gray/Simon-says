# Simon-says
This GitHub contains all of the information and files that we used in the making of our project
# Project Summary
In this project we used a raspberry pico board with an external breadboard to implement a Simon Says game. On the external breadboard, we had three RGB LEDs that we used to alternate colors and show a pattern. We used the buttons on the pico to be able to play back the pattern to continue the game. There was also an OLED screen that was used to display if you were correct or wrong and to let you know when to be ready to see the pattern. The internal buzzer was used to play a tune if you were right or buzz three times if you were wrong
